                    Everyone knows how fast our little ones' feet grow and the extortionate costs that come with that,
                    sometimes having to buy football footwear twice a year, for multiple children and multiple playing surfaces.
                    The impact, especially since COVID and the current economic crisis, can be overwhelming and often causes
                    unnecessary hardships.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As such, we are introducing The Glenavon Boot Room, a place where any child, at Glenavon or wider afield,
                    can exchange their old boots for a bigger size (moulded, 3G, and studded boots).
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are some really basic rules to using The Glenavon Boot Room, these are:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Boots must be clean of mud and in a good state of repair. They must include laces and have no holes.</li>
                    <li>Boots must NOT be fake.</li>
                    <li>You must provide your boots at the same time as collecting the new boots.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Should boots not be taken after 6 months, they will be donated to support the provision of boots to charities worldwide.
                </p>
